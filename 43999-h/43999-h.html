<p class="pfirst"><span>It was a fine spring morning, and
Kitty sat at the window looking
out at the green fields and the
trees with their young leaves, and
far, far beyond these to some towers
that looked small in the distance,
but when you came close to them
you found that they belonged to a
grand old castle in ruins.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This castle Kitty had long wished
to see, for she had heard so much
about it; and to-day she was
thinking very much about it, for she
knew that there was going to be a
great picnic, to which her cousins
were going, and Kitty wished she
were going also, but she had not
been invited.  As she gazed out
of the window she saw several
carriages full of people on their
way to the picnic.  Then the tears
came into Kitty's eyes, and she
dropped the book she was
holding in her hand, and opened the
window so that she might see the
carriages more clearly.  They were
going very quickly, and Kitty could
hear the people laughing and
talking as she watched them out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She gave a great sigh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How much I should like to
go!' she said, half aloud.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Just then the door opened, and
her Uncle George walked into the room.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, Uncle George, where have
you come from?' said Kitty,
jumping up.  'I thought you were not
coming home till next week.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I came home last night,' said
Uncle George, 'but I did not
expect to find you here.  I thought
you would be going to the picnic.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I should like to go,' said Kitty,
'but I was not invited.  I do not
know Mrs. Somers.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Neither do I,' said Uncle George;
'but suppose we have a little picnic
of our own, Kitty?  I have got my
dog-cart at the door, and there is
room in the castle grounds for a
dozen picnic parties; and we should
not take up much room.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Kitty clapped her hands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Put on your hat, then, and we
will go,' said Uncle George.  'My
little Kitty shall see the castle, and
climb the ruins.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, Uncle George, how good
you are!' said Kitty, as they drove
along.  'I never thought I should
be so happy as I am to-day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, Kitty,' said Uncle George
very gravely, 'I am afraid it can't
be quite a picnic, for we have
brought nothing to eat with us.
What shall we do?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shan't mind,' said Kitty; 'but
I am afraid that you will be hungry,
Uncle George.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Uncle George smiled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, we won't be starved,
Kitty; there is a nice little country
inn close by, where I put up my
horse, and I daresay we shall
manage to get something there.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And so they did; and Kitty saw
the old castle, and when she drove
home she said it was the happiest
day she had ever spent.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>'You must be sure to write it all
down, Jessy,' said Ellen, looking
over her sister's shoulder: 'you must
tell how naughty Bob was, and how
he threw your doll on the fire, and all
the wax melted, and that he broke my
doll's arms and legs, so that I have had
to sew them all over to keep the bran
from running out.'</span></p>

<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">'YOU MUST BE SURE TO WRITE IT ALL DOWN.'</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes—and how he trampled on our
gardens, and broke down my rose-bush
and all my pinks.  I don't think I shall
have room for all the things there are to
tell mamma about him.  There never
was such a naughty boy!  When he
gets one of his tempers he does not seem
to know what he is doing.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And Ellen leaned down on the table,
and went on writing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Just then the door opened, and Bob
himself came in.  He was a fat, rosy
little boy, and he did not look very
fierce now; indeed, he looked quite
meek and gentle.  He came up to
his sisters, and said, 'Bob is sorry;
he won't spoil dolls and gardens
again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ah! it is too late now, Bob,' said
Ellen; 'you have spoiled everything;
and I am telling mamma all about it in
my letter, so she won't bring you the
baker's cart and the whip that you
wanted.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You are a very naughty boy, Bob,'
said Jessy, 'and I am not going to play
with you again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Bob went very red.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take care; he's going into a temper
again,' said Ellen, as Bob made a snatch
at the letter she was writing.  She held
it out of his reach, and then he gave a
loud scream and began crying with all
his might.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'll go to nurse!' he cried, rushing
out of the room, shouting as loud as he
could.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He is the worst boy that ever lived!'
said Jessy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now we'll get on with the letter,'
said Ellen.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But just then they heard another
scream—which was not Bob—and then
a bumping noise on the stairs.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He's fallen down-stairs.  Perhaps
he's killed,' said Jessy, turning pale.
And the two girls ran to see what was
the matter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Yes, Bob, in his passion, did not see
where he was going, and he slipped, and
fell from the top of the stairs to the
bottom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, nurse, is he much hurt?' cried
Ellen, for nurse and the rest of the
servants were there.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was a long time before Bob came
to himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The doctor was sent for, and he found
that Bob's arm was broken; and poor
Bob had to suffer a great deal of pain in
having it set.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Poor Bob!' said Ellen to Jessy; 'we
won't send our letter to mamma.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No,' said Jessy; 'it will be a great
trouble to mamma to find poor Bob so
ill.  We will not give her any more
trouble.'  And she tore up the letter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But another letter was written to
mamma to tell her what had happened,
and she came at once.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Bob was lying quite still, muttering
something to himself, but only loud
enough for Ellen and Jessy to hear the
word 'Naughty, naughty.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But we did not think you would fall
down-stairs, Bob,' said Jessy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Bob looked up at Jessy, and said,
'No, no; naughty Bob, not naughty Jessy.'</span></p>

Farmer Jones, looking
down at them over the top bar
of the gate,
'you may come and play in the
field for a bit; only mind, there is
to be no chasing the sheep or hens,
or throwing stones at the ducks,
or it will be the last time you
children get leave to come into my
fields.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We won't do any mischief, sir,'
said Peggy earnestly, as she tried
to make the bundle she carried sit
upright, and look something like a
baby, instead of cuddling up like a
shapeless lump on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Very well, then, in you go.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The farmer held the gate open
till the five children and two babies
had filed sedately through; then he
dropped the bar into the socket, and
tramped away down the dusty lane.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The sheep were away at the far
side, and did not take the trouble
to glance up at the intruders.  The
hens were clucking busily on a piece
of bare ground beyond the barn.
Down in the lowest corner of the
field was a shallow pond, where
a plump mother duck and half a
dozen downy ducklings were sailing
placidly about.  They were
new-comers comparatively, and the
children greeted them with shouts of
approval.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why can't babies swim about
and do things, instead of always
crying and going to sleep?' asked
Tommy, eyeing his small twin
brothers with great dissatisfaction,
as they sat in a row on a fallen
tree-trunk.  'I'd rather have young
ducks any day; they've twice as
much sense.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'See that one eating up my bread
and butter!' cried Jack; 'he's
something like a duck.  I wish Farmer
Jones would give him to me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'm quite sure he wouldn't,' said
Peggy sharply; 'ducks are
dreadfully dear things: mother's said so
lots of times.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jack didn't answer; he was
leaning over the tree trunk, throwing
tiny bits of crusts to the duckling,
who was doing his best to choke
himself with them.  Soon after, the
duckling came round in front of the
trunk where they were sitting; and
it was the funniest little object, with
its stumpy wings, and a big yellow
bill that opened and shut like a
pair of scissors.</span></p>
<div class="align-center auto-scaled figure margin" style="width: 57%" id="figure-236">
<img class="align-center block" style="display: block; width: 100%" alt="'IT WAS THE FUNNIEST LITTLE OBJECT.'" src="images/img-22.jpg" />
<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">'IT WAS THE FUNNIEST LITTLE OBJECT.'</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>There were five more swimming
about beside their mother; there
might be dozens more in the
farmyard, while they had nothing of
their own.  A sharp little duck like
that would be as good as a dog
to play with.  Jack had watched
it with longing eyes; he was
certain the farmer would never miss
it, if he were to take it home for a
little while—only a little while; he
could easily bring it back again,
and it wouldn't be one bit the
worse.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The others played on with the
daisies and the butterflies; the
babies sucked their thumbs and
fell asleep in their small nurses'
arms; the little duck forgot his
mother and his brothers and sisters,
and strayed farther and farther
away after the crumbs, till presently
two small brown hands pounced
down, and he found himself a
prisoner.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Quack! quack!' called the
mother duck, missing the wanderer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Quack! quack!' cried the little duck.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Peggy and Bessy looked round.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, what are you doing, Jack?
Didn't Farmer Jones say you
weren't to tease the ducks?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who is teasing the ducks?'
demanded Jack, in a tone of injured
innocence.  'I'm going to take it
home for a bit, and teach it a lot of
tricks.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You'd better leave it alone!'
cried Peggy, in alarm; 'it would be
stealing.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It would be nothing of the
kind.  I'm not going to keep
the duck.  Girls haven't a bit of
sense; they're just made to go
telling tales.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't ever tell tales,' returned
Peggy, with dignity.  'Did I ever
tell who it was left the gate open
when the pigs got in that day?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, don't tell tales this time
either,' was Jack's only acknowledgment.
'We'd better be going now,
before anybody comes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jack was the biggest boy, and
liked his own way.  Moreover, he
generally made the rest like it too.
Peggy and Bessy uneasily got up
from their seat, and back the
procession went across the green grass
and daisies, Jack carrying the duck
inside his jacket, where it quacked
loudly, and made the company look
round anxiously, for fear of stray
listeners.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What will mother say when she
sees it?' suggested Tommy, as they
slunk along the lane.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother is not going to see it,'
returned Jack; 'it's going into the
wood-shed.  I'll make it a nice
house there, all to itself—better
than it had at the farm by a long way.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So instead of going straight into
the house, the party repaired to the
wood-shed at the end of the garden,
where the duck was carefully fenced
in behind some boards, and supplied
with the remainder of the crusts for
supper.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He'll go off to sleep in a bit,'
said Jack, with a sigh of relief.
'Now we'll go in; and mind, you're
not to say anything about it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was easy for Jack to say that,
but it wasn't by any means so easy
to do it.  Every minute or two
somebody would begin to say
something bearing upon the subject, and
break off short in sudden alarm.
Every time there was a moment's
silence, they would be listening for
faint quacks from the wood-shed,
and somehow it befell that there
came no further opportunity of
visiting the prisoner that evening;
for it was Saturday,—the great
festival of the bath-tub,—and by the
time the whole seven had gone
through the performance, it was too
late for anything but bed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Never mind; to-morrow would
be Sunday, and Jack promised
himself a lovely time with his dear
cluck.  He would slip a piece of
bread into his pocket at breakfast;
there was a noble ditch not very far
off, where nobody ever went, and
he would take it there for a swim.
Jack took a last look through the
curtainless window at the shed roof,
and went to bed brimful of plans
for to-morrow and the duck.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Ah, if that duck had but known
or understood the joys that lay
before him!  But he didn't; he was
only a poor solitary baby duck,
taken away from his mother and his
home, and left all alone in a cold,
strange place, and the night was
very long and very bleak, and his
little body ached with cold and
hunger, and he quacked and quacked
till his throat grew sore, and the
quacks wouldn't come any longer,
and at last, just as it was beginning
to grow grey morning, he feebly
curled up his yellow toes, and rolled
over on his back—and died!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Tommy, come down the garden,
and mind nobody sees you,' whispered
Jack, after breakfast.  'We'll
take that duck to the ditch, and
have some fun.  Hurry up!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two raced down to the
wood-shed; all was quiet enough
inside.  Jack looked round in some
astonishment.  'He must be fast
asleep yet; I thought he'd have
been quacking like anything for
some food.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Tommy was peering into the
corner.  He got up suddenly with
a startled face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Jack,' he said solemnly, 'I do
believe he's gone and died!  See
how he's lying.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jack had him up in his arms in
an instant.  He did not know much
about dead ducks, but the first
touch of the little body, that had
been so soft and warm the night
before, sent a cold chill right
through him.  He looked down at
it for a minute in speechless dismay,
and then he burst out into a perfect
storm of sobs.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let's go and tell mother,' said
Tommy, beginning to cry too; and
off they went.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But even mother could not bring
the little duck back to life.  She
quietly put it into a basket, and
told Jack to take it up to Farmer
Jones, and tell him all about his
wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Tommy went with him for company,
and the pair felt exactly as if
they were going to a funeral; and
certainly no funeral they had ever
seen went half so slowly, and with
so many halts and pauses.  Sooner
or later, however, they </span><em class="italics">had</em><span> to
get there, and Jack had to falter
out his confession as best he
might.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It was because it was such a
dear little duck that Jack wanted it,'
explained Tommy valiantly, when
Jack got to the end.  'We didn't
mean to hurt it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The farmer listened in grim
silence.  'Perhaps not,' he said;
'but I can't have you in my fields
again: you'll have to be content
with the lane for the rest of the
summer, so I'm thinking you'll find
it's been a dear duck for you more
ways than one.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother was quite right,' said
Jack, as they trudged back down
that dusty lane; 'ducks </span><em class="italics">are</em><span>
dreadfully dear things!'</span></p>

<div class="line"><span>In her winter coat and bonnet to-day?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Because she is going with mother away</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For a drive in a carriage and pair,'</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>said Uncle George, coming into
the room.  He always called his
niece Miss Muffle, though her real
name was Annette.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes,' said Miss Muffle, 'I am
going with my mother, and I shall
not be a bit cold.  I am never cold
in the winter; my mother keeps me
so warm.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes,' said Uncle George; 'your
father and mother are rich, and can
give their little girl all she wants.
I wonder if Miss Muffle would like
to go and see some little girls who
have no warm coats or shoes and
stockings?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Miss Muffle looked up at Uncle George.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I should like to see those little
girls, Uncle George.  Will you take
me to see them?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So Uncle George went in the
carriage with Miss Muffle and her
mother.  And as they were driving
along he told the coachman to stop
at some poor cottages near the
road.  He lifted Miss Muffle out
of the carriage, and told her mother
they would not be long, if she would
not mind waiting.  Uncle George
knocked at the door of the first cottage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Miss Muffle gave a little shiver,
for there was no fire, and sitting
close together on the floor were
three little children, trying to get
warm under an old shawl of their mother's.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And how are the children
getting on at school?' said Uncle George.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Only Ben has gone,' said the
mother, 'for the others have on
shoes, except a pair of slippers that
they wear in turn on fine days, but
such weather as this they would be
wet through at once.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have they had their dinner?'
asked Uncle George.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They have each had a piece of
dry bread; that is all I can give
them, for the father is out of work.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The tears were in Miss Muffle's eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Uncle George slipped out of the
door, and presently came back with
a great basket, which he opened,
and gave each of the children a
large sandwich, at sight of which
their eyes gleamed with joy.  How
hungry they were!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And you must get some coal at
once, Mrs. Trotter,' said Uncle
George, putting some money on
the table, and at the same time
taking out of the basket tea, sugar,
bread, cheese, bacon, and all sorts
of food.  'And you must have a
good meal for your husband and
the children, and we will see about
shoes and stockings in a day or two.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Uncle George,' said Miss Muffle,
when they returned to the carriage,
'I will give them all the money I
have, and father and mother will
give some, and we will buy clothes
and shoes and stockings for the
poor little children.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>'Never you mind what she says,
my lambie; there are no wolves
here at all, and Red Riding-hood
was not killed.  There, stop crying,
my beauty, and you shall come and
help me sort the linen in the next
room.  No, not you, Miss Jean;
one is enough to worrit; you just
stay here till tea-time, like a good girl.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So nurse went away with Baby,
leaving little seven-year-old Jean
alone in the great nursery.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The gas was not yet lit, and the
familiar room looked strange and
mysterious in the dim, uncertain
light of the fire.  The corners were
shrouded in gloom, and the
dancing flames threw huge, flickering
shadows upon the walls.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jean drew her stool nearer the
fire and shivered, but not with cold.
She was a very nervous child, with
a horror of the dark.  She could
not explain, even to herself, exactly
what it was she feared; it was a
kind of nameless something, but
the form it sometimes took was
'wolves.'  She knew there were no
wolves in this country, she knew
there was nothing to hurt her—yet
she was afraid.  The child was
often laughed at, and was much
ashamed of her fears, and no one
knew what she suffered at times.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Oh, the fright that story of Red
Riding-hood gave her!  In vain
she tried to think of something else;
it came back again and again, and
she shivered with sympathetic terror
as she pictured to herself Red
Riding-hood's walk through the wood,
and the horror she must have felt
when her grandmother turned out
to be a wolf!  Half of her knew
that it was only a fairy tale, and all
nonsense, but the other half argued
that Sibyl said it was true, and
Sibyl always spoke the truth.
Nurse said it was not true, but
then she only said that to soothe Baby.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So poor little Jean sat quaking
with fear, starting at every sound,
fancying that she saw things move,
and feeling that she must look
behind her, and yet dared not.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But at last tea was brought in;
nurse and Baby returned, the gas
was lit, and Jean forgot her fears,
for a time, in bread and jam.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The next day was Christmas
Eve, and there was a great deal of
fun going on at the Vicarage.  The
Merivals were a large family, and
every one had secrets from every
one else, and wonderful plans for the
morrow.  Mr. Merival always gave
a packet of tea and sugar to some
of the old women in the village on
Christmas Eve, and all of these had
been to the Vicarage that morning
to fetch it, except one.  She was a
poor old body, who lived about a
mile away, at the end of a wood,
and was often too ill with
rheumatism to venture out of doors.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sibyl,' said Mr. Merival, meeting
her in the hall as he went to put
on his greatcoat,—'Sibyl, I want
you to take Grannie Dawson her
tea this afternoon.  Take it before
dark.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'All right, father; I'll do it
when'—and Sibyl's voice was lost
in the distance as she bounded out
of doors.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Little giddy-pate!' ejaculated
her father; then, turning to Jean,
he said,—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'See that some one takes that
tea to poor old Grannie, little one.
I would not have her feel neglected
for anything.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So saying, he departed, leaving
the little girl in the hall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jean waited long and patiently,
but no one came.  Every one was
either busy or not to be found.
Mother and the elder girls were
decorating the church, the maids
were busy, and Sibyl and the three
boys were off on some important
business of their own.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As time went on, Jean became
more and more convinced that, as
usual, thoughtless Sibyl had
forgotten everything but what she was
doing at that moment.  It was past
three, it would soon be dark, and
Grannie Dawson's tea—what was
to be done?  Father would be
vexed with Sibyl if she forgot to
take it, and no one would like merry
Sibyl to be in disgrace on Christmas
Eve.  Could she go herself?  Oh
no; father never meant </span><em class="italics">her</em><span> to go.
Besides, it was getting dark, and
the way was through a wood.
Wolves!  Horrible thought!  And
yet poor old Grannie Dawson was
so ill, so lonely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sibyl!  Sibyl!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>No answer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Little Jean sat some time longer
struggling with herself.  Then she
started up, slipped on her little
warm red cloak, and, taking the
basket with the tea and sugar,
walked resolutely out of the house,
down the garden, and along the road.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The weather was cold—not real
nice Christmas cold, but damp and
raw, and the roads were wet and
sloppy with half-melted snow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jean's heart beat fast, and she
drew her cloak tightly round her as
she neared the wood.  The sky
was overcast, and the wind blew in
fitful gusts in her face, and sobbed
and sighed in the pine trees on
either side.  It really was very
dark in the wood.  The waving
branches made the shadows move
in a weird manner, and there was
no saying what evil beast might
not lurk behind those misty bushes,
ready to pounce out on the unwary
passer-by.</span></p>

<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">'SHE DREW HER CLOAK TIGHTLY ROUND HER.'</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child thought many times of
turning back, but then she
remembered the poor old woman, and
pressed on.  Her teeth chattered,
and she grasped her basket
convulsively, glancing on either side
with wide-open, terrified eyes.  Oh,
why had she come?  Surely that
was a wolf's howl—and behind
her, so that she could not turn back!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Very quietly she crept along till
she came in sight of the little
thatched cottage where Grannie
lived.  Then she gathered herself
together, ready to set off running.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But what was that noise?—it was
not fancy.  That huge form bounding
towards her—a wolf!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>With a wild scream of terror, little
Jean fled towards the cottage, the
wolf after her.  Nearer and nearer
it came, but fear lent wings to the
child's feet, and she just reached
the door in time to burst in and
slam it in the wolf's face.  Then
she threw herself on the floor
and burst into a fit of frightened
crying.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, the wolf! the wolf!' she
sobbed, as old Grannie tried to
soothe her.  'Listen, it is at the
door.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And sure enough the old woman
heard it whining and scratching
outside, and then came the sound
of a man's voice.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Leaving Jean in the next room,
Grannie Dawson opened the door,
and in walked—Farmer Martin and
his big collie!  So big and shaggy
was that collie-dog, and yet so very
quiet and gentle, that no child, even
timid little Jean, could be afraid of
him.  The Merivals knew him well,
and used often to pet and tease him
when they went to the farm to see
Mrs. Martin, and the farmer had
now called at Grannie Dawson's
cottage to ask whose child it was
who seemed so afraid of his dog.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So the wolf was only dear old
Cheviot, who had recognised Jean,
and wanted to be patted.  Oh, how
relieved she was, and how much
ashamed of herself!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When Jean had recovered
herself a little, kind Farmer Martin
carried her home in his arms,
Cheviot trotting on before, wagging
his tail and looking over his shoulder
at her, as if to apologise for
frightening her so.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was quite dark when they
reached the Vicarage, and some of
the family had come home, and
were wondering where Jean could
be.  The farmer told her story,
and, to her surprise, she was petted
and made much of by all.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But she had had a serious fright;
her nerves were shaken, and she
was not at all well for some days.
The Merival children began to see
that what they had laughed at as
'Jean's nonsense' was very real to
her.  They left off teasing and
laughing at her, and encouraged
her instead, for each of them
wondered, in their heart of hearts, if
they themselves could have shown
such true courage as little Jean
showed when she did what she
was so much afraid of because she
thought it right.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jean was always nervous, but
she left off being afraid of 'wolves,'
for each time she heard her new
pet name of Red Riding-hood she
remembered what that terrible wolf
had turned out to be.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Lilla had more dolls than she
knew what to do with.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Some were sitting in chairs, some
lying in cradles, and one was seated
in a perambulator.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have more dolls than any
other little girl has,' said she, as
she held three in her arms.  'I
have been counting them, and I
have fifteen large dolls, and ten
small ones, and twelve very small
ones, and then there are the little
china dolls in the bath and in the
china cradles.  To think of one
little girl having so many dolls,
mother!  Sometimes I think I have
too many.  And there is no one
but myself to play with them.  I
wish I knew what to do with them all.'</span></p>

<span class="italics">'SHE HELD THREE IN HER ARMS.'</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Lee stroked Lilla's curly hair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, said Mrs. Lee, 'there are
some very good little girls at the
school in the village, and I am sure
it would be a great treat to them to
see all your dolls.  And I want to
give them a treat, so I will ask
them to come here, and you shall
arrange all your dolls and playthings
in the nursery for them to
look at.  Don't you think that will
be a very good plan?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Lilla clapped her hands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, how very nice that would be!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And she and her mother dressed
the dolls in their best clothes, and
placed them all round the nursery.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How pretty they look!' said
Lilla; 'I think the little girls will
like them.  And may I give them
some dolls to take home?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You may do as you please,' said
Mrs. Lee, 'for they are your own
dolls.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So the little girls came—six of
them; and they all said, 'Oh!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What a lot of dolls!' said one
little girl; 'more dolls than there
are at the shop.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After the show Mrs. Lee gave
the children some tea and
plumcake; and then Lilla handed each
of them a doll.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How pleased were the six little
girls when they found they were
each to have a doll!  And all of
them said that Miss Lilla's doll
show was the best treat they had
ever had.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>'I should like to have a large
wax doll of my own,' said
Selina; 'large enough for me to
make clothes for, with buttons and
strings, to fasten and unfasten: I
should play with it all day, and
undress it at night, and put it in a
cradle.  It should have eyes to open
and shut, and I should shut them
at night, and then it would seem to
be asleep.  How nice it would be!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Selina was sitting in the garden
talking to herself, and did not think
that any one heard her; but her
mother had come into the garden
and heard what her little girl was
saying.</span></p>
<div class="align-center auto-scaled figure margin" style="width: 58%" id="figure-247">
<img class="align-center block" style="display: block; width: 100%" alt="'SELINA WAS SITTING IN THE GARDEN.'" src="images/img-57.jpg" />
<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">'SELINA WAS SITTING IN THE GARDEN.'</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have two or three dolls,
Selina,' said she.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, mother, but they are small
ones, and I want a very large one.
And my dolls have brown hair and
black eyes, and I want a doll with
blue eyes and light hair, and one
that can open and shut its eyes, like
Cousin Bella's.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And Selina looked up at her mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, will you buy one for me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am afraid that I cannot buy
one for you.  I have not so much
money as your Aunt Sarah has to
spend upon dolls and playthings.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Selina was silent for a moment,
then she said,—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, I know that.  Mother, I
do not care about the large doll.
I will make some new clothes for
my small ones, and try to think
that they are large.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is a good child,' said her
mother; 'and perhaps some day I
shall be able to get a larger one
for you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So Selina tried to think no more
of her Cousin Bella's large doll,
and her mother gave her a piece
of muslin to make a frock for one
of her own dolls, and some blue
ribbon for a sash.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Selina sewed away merrily, and
she and her mother talked over a
letter that had come from her
father, who was in France, and
who said he hoped to be home
again in a day or two.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And tell Selina that I have got
a box for her, with a present inside.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I wonder what it is?' said Selina.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She had not long to wait, for
two days after they had had the
letter, her father came.  They
were very glad to see him, and
he was very glad to see them.
And for a little time Selina forgot
all he had said about a present.
But her father said,—-</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, Selina, you have not asked
about your present.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh dear no!  I had quite forgotten,'
said Selina.  'What is it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That you must find out,' said
her father.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So Selina had the box opened.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, mother, mother! look,
look!  It is the most beautiful
doll I have ever seen—more beautiful
than Cousin Bella's, and it has
light hair and blue eyes, and is
as large as a baby.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I bought it in Paris,' said her
father.  'They make very
wonderful dolls there—dolls that can
speak; and this doll that I have
bought for my little Selina can say
"Mamma" and "Papa."'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How pleased was Selina with
her doll!  Her father showed her
how to press the doll to make
it speak, and all Selina's little
friends came to see the wonderful
French doll that could say
'Mamma' and 'Papa.'</span></p>

the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
